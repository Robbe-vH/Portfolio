            <p class="description">
                I would like to describe myself as a person who is eager to learn and develop his skills.
                    During my free time, I spend a lot of time on Pluralsight learning new skills to add to my set.
                    As a
                    kid, I used to love experimenting with electronics, disassembeling old amplifiers, RC cars and
                    planes and making them into new Frankenstein devices. When I got my first job, most of my money
                    was
                    spend on hardware for building a PC and that's where my IT journey started. I got hands on
                    experience with making a hackingtosh, swapping every component, installing Linux, crashing the
                    system a couple of times and fixing it. At the time it felt like having a new world opening, the
                    possibilities where endless. Now those years pay off in terms of the experience on system
                    administration. There is still much to learn in the system domain, but of course my main
                    interest is
                    programming.
                    I started my journey in 5th grade back in high school, the usual introduction to web
                    development,
                    Java, OOP in Visual Basic, etc. After completing two years of high school, I dropped out for a
                    non
                    IT-related job which I thought would be giving me enough sattisfaction, but after a couple of
                    years,
                    I felt like I missed programming too much and I enrolled in a undergraduate degree in Programming
                    at
                    PXL.

                <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>

                <p>
                    My journey in web design started back in high school, where I was introduced to the basics of
                    HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript and PHP. In university, I came into contact with version control
                    through Git and learned how to use frameworks like Bootstrap effectively. At PXL, I used
                    Pluralsight courses to learn the basics of angular, which I really started to love after getting
                    used to Typescript.

                <p>
                    C# is one of the more technical languages I learn at PXL, but the Object Oriented Programming
                    ideas relate a lot to Jasvascript. Making this is my second most favorite course.

                <p>
                    I am not great with SQL and database structures, but it is a vital part of making basically any
                    sort of website that has to store data. Though I don't really like working with the language, I
                    am able to do basicv selections, subquerries and functions.

                    I have been running a Debain/Proxmox based server for some time at home. As my main driver on my laptop 
                    I use Arch Manjaro. My experience with Linux runs back to high school when I first installed Ubuntu.
                    The possibilities have always interested me a lot.
